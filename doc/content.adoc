== Introduction

A filesystem toolset and storage implementation for Clojure. On one
side you have a collection of functions for:

- work with paths (creating and manipulating).
- work with the filesystem (files and directories crud and many predicates).
- IO (clojure.java.io implementation for paths).

And on the other side it provides a *Storage* abstraction, that facilitates abstract
filesystem access under uniform api for web applications.


== Install

Add the following dependency to your project.clj file:

[source,clojure]
----
[funcool/datoteka "1.2.0"]
----


== User Guide

=== Path & Filesystem

The path and filesystem helper functions are all exposed under the `datoteka.core` namespace, so let's import it:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[datoteka.core :as fs])
----

This library uses JVM NIO, so under the hood, the `java.nio.file.Path` is used instead of classical `java.io.File`.
You have many ways to create a *path* instance. The basic one is just using the `path` function:

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/path "/tmp")
;; => #path "/tmp"
----

As you can observe, the path properly prints with a *data reader*, so once you have imported the library, you can
use the `#path "/tmp"` syntax to create paths.

The paths also can be created from a various kind of objects (such as URI, URL, String and seq's):

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/path (java.net.URI. "file:///tmp"))
;; => #path "/tmp"

(fs/path (java.net.URL. "file:///tmp"))
;; => #path "/tmp"

(fs/path ["/tmp" "foo"])
;; => #path "/tmp/foo"
----

The `path` function is also variadic, so you can pass multiple arguments to it:

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/path "/tmp" "foo")
;; => #path "/tmp/foo"

(fs/path (java.net.URI. "file:///tmp") "foo")
;; => #path "/tmp/foo"
----

And for convenience, you can use the `clojure.java.io` api with paths in the same way as you
have done it with `java.io.File`:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(io/reader (fs/path "/etc/inputrc"))
;; => #object[java.io.BufferedReader 0x203dc326 "java.io.BufferedReader@203dc326"]

(subs (io/slurp (fs/path "/etc/inputrc")) 0 20)
;; => "# do not bell on tab"
----

Look on the <<reference,reference>> section for the complete documentation
of all available functions and predicates.


=== Storages

On the contrary to the raw filesystem manipulation functions, the
storages abstraction offers a thin and carefully designed api for
implement mostly generic file storage abstraction. It is designed
mainly for web applications in mind but is not strictly limited to it.

But, *why I need this?* you may be asking yourself... the storage api
allows you work with files (such that file uploads as a good example)
starting with storing them on local filesystem and then easily switch
to a cloud based storage (such that AWS S3 or any other) just
providing an implementation for the very restricted and small storage
api.

The `datoteka` comes by default with a *local filesystem* storage as
base storage and many other that stacks on top of other storages and
provides additional functionality.

The main api for work with storages is exposed under `datoteka.storages`
namespace and it consists mainly on this functions: `save`, `lookup`,
`exists?`, `delete` and `public-url` (it has some other functions but
they are not relevant for now).


==== Local FileSystem Storage

The local storage is a default implementation of storage abstraction
that stores the files in a local file system. Let create an instance
of it:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[datoteka.storages :as st])
(require '[datoteka.storages.local :refer [localfs]])

(def storage
  (localfs {:basedir "/tmp/"
            :baseuri "http://localhost/media/"}))
----

Let save some data using the storage api:

[source, clojure]
----
@(st/save storage "test-file.txt" "some-content")
;; => #path "test-file.txt"
----

The `save` function returns a promise (an instance of
CompletableFuture) with the final path relative to the provided
`:basedir` to the storage.

If you application works in a synchronous way, just use the `@` or
`deref` function. It blocks the current thread until the underlying
operation is finished. And if you application has an asynchronous
workflow, you can just use `funcool/promesa` for work with promises in
a more comfortable way.

This approach allows easy use of the storage api in both possible
workflows.

Now, let see what is happens if you try to store the same file again:

[source, clojure]
----
user=> @(st/save storage "test-file.txt" "some-content")
;; => #path "test-file1.txt"
----

As you can observe, the storage handles duplicates for you. You don't
need to worry about the filenames. If a duplicate name is used, another
name will be automatically chosen.

NOTE: at the moment an incremental integer is used for choice of a
new name but this may no longer be valid in a future version. You
should always rely on the return value of `save` function instead of
having the assumption that the strategy of choosing a new name will be
the same.

The 3rd argument to the `save` function represents the contents
of the file. It accepts anything that can be coerced to InputStream
with `clojure.java.io/input-stream` with the small exception for
strings, that instead of interpreting them as paths it interprets them
as content.

You can check if a file exists with the `st/exists?` predicate:

[source, clojure]
----
@(st/exists? storage "test-file.txt")
;; => true

@(st/exists? storage "other.txt")
;; => false
----

Also, you can lookup the file in the storage by the relative path:

[source, clojure]
----
@(st/lookup storage "test-file.txt")
;; => #path "/tmp/test-file.txt"
----

The return value of lookup is a promise resolved with the absolute
path on the local filesystem. And if you are working in a web
application, the `public-url` is your friend:

[source, clojure]
----
(st/public-url storage "test-file.txt")
;; => object[java.net.URI 0xa215deb "http://localhost/media/test-file.txt"]
----

This function just returns a concatenation of the relative path of the
file with the provided URI on `:baseuri` option on storage
constructor.

NOTE: In summary, this allows us to persist files in local file system
and store relative paths on the database, which in turn allows future
filesystem relocation without worrying about the need of any change on
your code or the database.

Additionally to the explained functions, there is the `delete` function
that given relative path or file name tries removing it:

[source, clojure]
----
@(st/delete storage "test-file.txt")
;; => true

@(st/delete storage "test-file.txt")
;; => false
----


==== Scoped Storage

The *scoped* storage is considered stacked storage because it works on top of an other storage
implementation, just adding an additional feature to it. In this case just scoping the main
storage base directory by a prefix.

Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[datoteka.storages :as st])
(require '[datoteka.storages.local :refer [localfs]])
(require '[datoteka.storages.misc :refer [scoped]])

(def storage
  (localfs {:basedir "/tmp/"
            :baseuri "http://localhost/media/"}))

(def scoped-storage
  (scoped storage "subdir"))
----

And then, a simple example interacting with the scoped storage:

[source, clojure]
----
;; Works in the same way as the plain `storage` for store files
@(st/save scoped-storage "test-file.txt" "some-content")
;; => #path "test-file.txt"

;; With the exception that when `lookup` it used:

@(st/lookup scoped-storage "test-file.txt")
;; => #path "/tmp/subdir/test-file.txt"

@(st/lookup storage "subdir/test-file.txt")
;; => #path "/tmp/subdir/test-file.txt"
----


==== Hashed Storage

In the same way as *scoped*, the *hashed* storage is a stacked storage
and requires another storage to work.

The *hashed* storage provides a very nice improvement over a plain
storage making the resulting path not guessable and not deterministic.
Very useful when you want to expose some downloads under the public address
but avoid easy file lookup through brute-force.

Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[datoteka.storages :as st])
(require '[datoteka.storages.local :refer [localfs]])
(require '[datoteka.storages.misc :refer [hashed]])

(def storage
  (localfs {:basedir "/tmp/"
            :baseuri "http://localhost/media/"}))

(def hashed-storage (hashed storage))
----

And then, a simple example interacting with the scoped storage:

[source, clojure]
----
@(st/save hashed-storage "test-file.txt" "some-content")
;; => #path "iP2/qIG/PBM/msJ/sJW/zU7/NM4Y49T394nc1jPsqQvvCAsn/test-file.txt"

@(st/lookup hashed-storage "iP2/qIG/PBM/msJ/sJW/zU7/NM4Y49T394nc1jPsqQvvCAsn/test-file.txt"
;; => #path "/tmp/iP2/qIG/PBM/msJ/sJW/zU7/NM4Y49T394nc1jPsqQvvCAsn/test-file.txt"
----

The hash is split in multiple directories for avoid create a huge
number of files under the same directory (that depending on the
underlying filesystem used for the hard drive may imply some
performance penalties for file access when the directory contains a
huge number of files).

Also, the hash is generated taking 64 bytes of true random data (using
`SecureRandom`) and hashing it with SHA-256 and encoding the result
using a url-safe variant of base64.

(fs/relativize "/tmp/foo/bar.txt" "/tmp/test")
;; => #path "../foo/bar.txt"
----


[[list-dir]]
===== list-dir

A helper for recursively list all contents of the directory. The return value of this
function is a lazy-seq.

WARNING: You need to realise all the sequence in order to properly close all acquired resources for
this operation, independently if you need or not all resources. If you don't want to worry about
resource management, just coerce the value to a vector using `vec` function.

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/list-dir "/tmp/subdir")
;; => (#path "/tmp/subdir/test-file.txt" #path "/tmp/subdir/test-file.html")
----

Optionally, you can pass a *glob expression* as second parameter for filter result.

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/list-dir "/tmp/subdir", "*.txt")
;; => (#path "/tmp/subdir/test-file.txt")
----


[[create-dir]]
===== create-dir

A helper for creating a new directory or directories. In fact this works
in the same way as `mkdir -p`, or in other words, it creates all not
existing parent directories for you.

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/create-dir "/tmp/subdir/testdir")
;; => #path "/tmp/subdir/testdir"
----

If the directory is already exists, no action is performed and the
path to the directory is returned.


[[move]]
===== move

Move or rename a file to a target file. If the target file exists,
by default it will be replaced.

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/move "/tmp/foo.txt" "/tmp/bar.txt")
;; => #path "/tmp/bar.txt"
----

Also, by default an atomic move will be performed and an exception
will be raised if your system does not support that. You can pass your
own flags as the third optional argument to the `move` function.

This is a list of available flags: `:atomic`, `:replace` and
`:copy-attributes`. The default flags are `#{:atomic :replace}`.

.Example using not atomic move.
[source, clojure]
----
(fs/move "/tmp/bar.txt" "/tmp/foo.txt" #{:replace})
;; => #path "/tmp/foo.txt"
----


[[create-tempdir]]
===== create-tempdir

Creates a temporary directory.

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/create-tempdir)
;; => #path "/tmp/547228100008922024"

(fs/create-tempdir "myprefix")
;; => #path "/tmp/myprefix5085100141359807070"
----

The user of this function is responsible for removing it when it is not
longer needed.


[[create-tempfile]]
===== create-tempfile

Create a temporary file.

[source, clojure]
----
(fs/create-tempfile)
;; => #path "/tmp/4790584308117167851.tmp"

(fs/create-tempfile :suffix ".txt" :prefix "test")
;; => #path "/tmp/test7617683814929744528.txt"
----

The user of this function is responsible for removing it when it is not
longer needed.


[[slurp-bytes]]
===== slurp-bytes

Is a similar function to the `slurp` but instead of reading the contents of the file as
string, it reads it as `byte` array.

[source,clojure]
----
(fs/slurp-bytes "/proc/cpuinfo")
;; => #object["[B" 0x19b8169d "[B@19b8169d"]
----
